Code Book

Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?
the codebook should be a good description of the data in your tidy data set, and while you could start work on it right now, I think it would make more sense to leave it until you have worked out what variables you are keeping so you are only describing data that is actually in your data set (a codebook that describes things not in your data set is a flawed codebook)
Due to the length of the variable names I have used camel case to make them more readable
basic format of that book is 
	•	variable name
	•	variable field width
	•	variable definition
	•	range of values

the codebook accurately describes the contents of the file
Data Description, Summary Choices, and Study Design (?, copy/paste)

Aufbau der Variablen: NAME-STDoderMEAN-ACHSE (XYZ) (if appropriate)
nicht zu lang, abbrevations like „Acc“ for Acceleration
